# Excel IO
A program written as general practice with the OpenPYXL module with the intent to offer a simple and professional looking program for converting .xlsx files to .txt files and vice versa.

This program can convert several text files into one excel spreadsheet too at once, rather than having the use do it one by one manually.

Examples of the program's output can be seen in the Examples folder, where both examples use the same set of data.
